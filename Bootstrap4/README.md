# Whiskey Monthly project for CI FSWDC.

### Here is a small project I am workign on for my Fullstack Web Dev course.

I am working with HTML and using Bootstrap v4 to style. 

It is my first time using Bootstrap in this course.

Almost all code is copied from the Code Institute Github source code: 

(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/BootstrappingYourNextBigIdea-BS4/master/02-CoreCSSAndTheGridSystem/04-responsive_design/video_solution/index.html)

The table inserted at the end was created by me using prior HTML table knowledge and some help from the Bootstrap Documentation site.

I will continue to style the site as I learn more about Bootstrap on the course.
